            <p>Janie Tsao is known for having co-founded Linksys and selling it to Cisco Systems for $500m in 2003. In 1988, the Tsaos had an idea for a product that would allow multiple computers to share a printer Janie, then 35 years old, quit her job to start Linksys and the couple financed the company with their savings. They founded the company in their garage. The company's first product was a success and by 1991, it was generating enough profit to allow Victor to also quit his job and work on the company full-time.
